FEATURES:
	- Install this IPKG on your fresh OpenWRT "Backfire", and out
	comes (hopefully) a ready-to-use PirateBox, a project by NYU
	Professor David Darts.
	- Now supports devices with 4 MByte flash
	- See https://github.com/MaStr/mkPirateBox/wiki for current
	router support status.
	- Runs with lighttpd Webserver

TODO:
	- Test other platforms
	- Improve error checking
	- Does not cleanly update, yet. "opkg remove piratebox" first.

PLEASE HELP:
	PirateBox v0.2+ is expected to run on many or even most untested
	router models. If something goes wrong, I usually can easily make
	it work if you help me out. If you decide to try mkPirateBox on
	an untested router model, please send send me feedback on how it
	went, including
	- your router model
	- output of the command
	"cat /etc/openwrt_release /etc/config/wireless /etc/config/network".
	- Thanks! :)
